		\begin{theorem}{For every $k \in \mathbb{N} $ there exists a tree $T_k$ with $\Gamma (T_k) = k$}
			In the following we will show how to construct $T_k$ by induction. 
			Additionally to $\Gamma (T_k) = k$, every $T_k$ will have a greedy coloring so that the root of $T_k$ is colored with color $k$.  
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \emph{Base} \\
					$T_1$ is just a single vertex without edges. Obviously $\Gamma (T_1) = 1$ and the color of the root of $T_1$ is 1.
				\item \emph{Induction step} \\
					For any $k > 1$, $T_k$ can be constructed by using one new vertex $v$ and $T_1$, $T_2$, ... $T_{k-1}$. 
					By connecting the roots of $T_1$, $T_2$ ... $T_{k-1}$ to $v$ we ensure that there is a greedy coloring in which $v$ has to have the color $k$. 
					This greedy coloring can be achieved by first coloring $T_1$, $T_2$, ...$T_{k+1}$ by induction so that the roots have the colors $1$, $2$, ... $k-1$. 
					Now we can color $v$ with the color $k$ because by construction all colors smaller than $v$ are already taken by the nodes adjacent to $v$. 
					Hence, we constructed $T_k$ with a root node $v$ which has color $k$ and $\Gamma (T_k) = k$. 
			\end{itemize}
		\end{theorem}
		Finally, by using the proven theorem we know that $min\{k \in \mathbb{N} | \Gamma(T) \leq k\ for\ all\ trees\ T\} = \infty$. 
		
		
		\begin{theorem}{For any Graph $G$  $\Gamma(G) \leq max_{uv \in E(G)} min\{deg(u), deg(v)\} + 1$}
		For the sake of contradiction let's assume that there is a graph $G$ with $\Gamma(G) = k$ and $k > max_{uv \in E(G)} min\{deg(u), deg(v)\} + 1$. 
		Additionally, let $G$ be colored with a greedy coloring using $k$ colors which obviously has to exist if $\Gamma(G) = k$. \\
		Let $v \in V(G)\ with\ c(v) = k$ be one of the vertices with the highest color. 
		Now, $deg(v) \geq k-1$  for $c(v)=k$ to be possible in a greedy coloring, because $v$ has to have atleast $k-1$ adjacent vertices which are colored in colors $1$ through $k-1$. \\
		By assumption we know that for all neighbours $u$ of $v$, $k> min\{deg(v), deg(u)\} + 1$. 
		Now we easily see that $deg(u) < deg(v)$ because else  $k > min\{deg(v), deg(u)\} + 1 = deg(v) + 1$ but earlier we saw that $deg(v) \geq k-1$. 
		Hence, we know that for all neighbours $u$ of $v$ the following inequality holds: $k > min\{deg(u), deg(v)\} + 1 = deg(u) + 1 \Leftrightarrow deg(u) < k - 1$. \\
		Now for $c(v)=k$ to hold in a proper greedy coloring we need to find a neighbour $u$ of $v$ with $c(u)=k-1$ which was colored before $v$. 
		Because $deg(u) > k-1$ $u$ only has $k-2$ neighbours which are not $v$. 
		Hence if $v$ is not already colored $c(u) < k-1$ so it is impossible to greedy color $v$ with the color $k$. 
		This finally leads to a contradiction, hence $k > max_{uv \in E(G)} min\{deg(u), deg(v)\} + 1$ was a wrong assumption and for every graph $\Gamma(G) > max_{uv \in E(G)} min\{deg(u), deg(v)\} + 1$ holds.

			\begin{theorem}{A planar truangulation is $4-colorable$ if and only if its plane dual is $3-edge-colorable$}
				Let $G=(V,E)$ be a planar triangulation and $H=(E,E')$ its plane dual.\\
			
				\begin{mylemma} {Let $G,H$ be graphs as defined before, then $L(G) is isomorph to L(H)$}
					\\
					\begin{itemize}
						\item $\textbf{|V(L(G))| = |V(L(H))|}$\\
							Let $e \in E(G)$ be the corresponding edge of a node in $V(L(G))$, then $\exists f_1,f_2 - face$, so that $e$ is in the border of $f_1, f_2$ ($G$ is planar triangulation, hence, a edge always is in the border of exactly $2$ unique faces). Because $H$ is the plane dual of $G$, $f_1,f_2 \in V(H)$, furthermore, because $f_1$ and $f_2$ are adjacent faces, $e'=f_1f_2 \in E(H)$.\\
							Because $e'$ is crossing $e$ in the plane, and $e'$ is unique (because $f_1$ and $f_2$ are unique), $e'$ will be called $'the associated edge to e$ ($a(e)=e'$) in the following.\\
							However, there is $e' \in E(H)$, thus, there is a unique corresponding vertex in $V(L(H))$.\\
							
							On the other side, let $e \in E(H)$ be the corresponding edge of a node in $V(L(H))$, then $\exists f_1, f_2 - face$, so that $e=f_1 f_2$. Because $f_1$ and $f_2$ are adjacent, there has to be an edge $e' \in E(G)$ (unique), so that $e'$ is in the border of $f_1$ and $f_2$.\\
							Because $e'$ is crossing $e$ in the plane, and $e'$ is unique (because $f_1$ and $f_2$ are unique), $e'$ will be called $'the associated edge to e$ ($a(e)=e'$) in the following.\\
							However, there is a unique corresponding vertex in $V(L(H))$\\
							
							Finally, foreach vertex in $V(L(G))$ there  is a unique vertex in $V(L(H))$ and vice versa. Moreover, $a(a(e)) = e \forall e \in V(L(G)) \cap V(LG(H))$, because each face in $G$ is adjacent to exactly 3 different faces, sharing exactly one edge with each, hence the associated edge is unique in both ways.\\
							Thus $|V(L(G))| = |V(L(H))|$, with isomorphism a.
							 
						\item $\textbf{E(L(G)) isomorph to E(L(H))}$\\
							Let $e \in E(L(G))$, then $\exists e_1,e_2 \in E(G)=V(L(G))$, so that $e_1$ and $e_2$ are adjacent, and $e=e_1e_2$. Let $e_1' = a(e_1) and e_2'=a(e_2) \in E(H)=V(L(H))$ be the associated edges of $e_1$ and $e_2$.
							Because $e_1$ and $e_2$ are adjacent, there is a face $f$ in $G$, so that $e_1$ and $e_2$ are in the border of $f$.\\
							Hence, $e_1'$ and $e_2'$ are both incident to the same face of $G$, in othere words, $e_1'$ and $e_2'$ are adjacent, in other words, $e_1'e_2' \in E(L(H))$.\\\\
							
							On the other side, let $e \in E(L(H))$, then $\exists e_1,e_2 \in E(H)=V(L(H))$, so that $e_1$ and $e_2$ are adjacent, and $e=e_1e_2$.
							Because $e_1$ and $e_2$ are adjacent, there exists a face $f$ in $G$, with $e_1$ and $e_2$ incident to $f$. Let, $e_1'=a(e_1)$ and $e_2'=a(e_1) \in E(G)=V(L(G))$ be the associated edges of $e_1$ and $e_2$ ($e_1,e_2$ are in the border of $f$, else $e_i$ wouldn't cross $e_i' (i \in  \{1,2\}))$. Now $G$ is a plane triangulation, hence, the order of $f$ is 3, in other words, $e_1'$ and $e_2'$ are adjacent, so $e_1'e_2' \in E(L(G))$.
					\end{itemize}			
					
					All in all, $a$ is a isomoprhism between $L(G)$ and $L(H)$, hence, $L(G)$ and $L(H)$ are isomorph.
				\end{mylemma}
				
				
				As shown in $\textbf{Lemma 2.1}$ $L(G)$ and $L(H)$ are isomorph, hence, $G$ is $4-edge-colorable$ if and only if $H$ is $4-edge-colorable$.\\\\
				
				Let $G$ be $3-edge-colorable$, then, by $\textbf{Vizing's theorem}$, $2 \le \triangle(G) \le 3$. Moreover, because of the \emph{first lemma in chapter colorings} $\triangle \le 4$.\\\\
				
				Let $G$ be $4-colorable$.

		Let $G=(V=\{v_1,...,v_n\}, E)$ be a graph.
			
		\begin{mylemma}$(A(G)^k)[i,j])=a^k_{i,j}$ represents the amount of $v_i\unaryminus v_j \unaryminus paths ~of ~lengt~h k$ ($i,j \in \{1,...,n\}$.\\
		
			\emph{proof} Prove by induction ofer k.\\
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \emph{Base: $k=1$}\\
					$A(G)[i,j] =  \{e \in E ~ : ~ e=v_iv_j\} = \{p ~ - ~ path ~ : ~ p=(v_i,v_j)\} ~ \in \{0,1\}$
				\item \emph{Step: $k \ge 1$}\\
					$(A(G)^k)[i,j] = (A(G)^{k-1} * A(G))[i,j] = (\sum_{a=1}^{n}\sum_{b=1}^{n}\sum_{d=1}^{n}(A(G)^{k-1})[a,d] * A(G)[d,b])[i,j]=$\\
					$\sum_{d=1}^{n}(A(G)^{k-1})[i,d] * A(G)[d,j]$.\\
					By induction $(A(G)^{k-1})[i,d]$ is the amount of $v_i\unaryminus v_d\unaryminus paths~ of ~length~ k-1$, and $A(G)[d,j]$ is the amount of $v_d\unaryminus v_j\unaryminus paths~ of ~length ~1$. So $(A(G)^{k-1})[i,d] * A(G)[d,j]$ is the amount of $v_i\unaryminus v_j\unaryminus paths ~of ~length~ k$ containing $v_dv_j$. To get all paths of length k, all possible incident edges of $v_j$ have to be checked.\\
					So all in all, $(A(G)^k)[i,j] = \sum_{d=1}^{n}(A(G)^{k-1})[i,d] * A(G)[d,j]$ is the amount of all $v_i\unaryminus v_j \unaryminus paths~ of ~length ~k$.
			\end{itemize} 
		\end{mylemma}
				
			\begin{itemize}
				\item (a)$tr(A(G))=0$\\
					Because G doesn't have any self-loops, $A(G)[i,i] = 0 ~ \forall i \in \{1,...,n\}$.\\
					Therefore: $tr(A(G))=\sum_{i=1}^{n}A[i,i] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}0=0$
					\\
				\item (b)$tr(A(G)^2 ~equals$ twice the number of edges of G.\\
					$tr(A(G)^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}A[i,k] * A[k,i]=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}A[k,i]^2$\\
					$=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}A[i,k]=\sum_{i=1}^{n}d(v_n)=2*|E|$.
					
				\item (c)$tr(A(G)^3) ~equals$ six times the number of triangles in G.\\
					As proven in $Lemma ~ 3.0.1$, $(A(G)^k)[i,i]$ is the amount of $v_i\unaryminus v_i \unaryminus paths ~of ~length ~3$.\\
					Because a closed path of length $3$ is a triangle, $(A(G)^k)[i,i]$ is the amount of triangles containing $v_i$.\\
					Moreover, a triangle $t=(v_i,v_j,v_k)$ can be interpreted as two different paths: $p_1=v_iv_jv_kv_i$ and $p_2=v_iv_kv_jv_i$. Thus, for each two paths there is one triangle. Moreover, a triangle contains three vertices, meaning that triangle counts for each vertex extra.\\
					All in all, we find each triangle in 3 different entries, two times in each, thus, 6 times in $A^k(G)$.

		\begin{theorem}{The adjacency matrix of any $d$-regular graph has an eigenvalue of $d$.}
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be a $d$-regular graph and let $A(G) = (a_{ij})_{i, j = 1,\dots, n}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) denote it's adjacency matrix. We show that
				\begin{equation*}
					A(G) \cdot (1, \dots ,1)^{\top} = (d,  \dots ,d)^{\top} = d \cdot (1,  \dots ,1)^{\top}
				\end{equation*}
			and thereby that $d$ is an eigenvalue of $G$. Since $G$ is $d$-regular, every row sum equals exactly $d$:
				\begin{equation*}
					\forall i \in [1, \dots, n]: \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij} = d
				\end{equation*}
			Trivially,
				\begin{equation*}
					A(G) \cdot (1, \dots ,1)^{\top} =  (\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{1j},  \dots , \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{nj})^{\top} = (d, \dots, d)^\top = d \cdot (1,  \dots ,1)^{\top}

		\begin{theorem}{The adjacency matrix of any bipartite, $d$-regular graph has an eigenvalue of $-d$.}
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be a bipartite, $d$-regular graph and let $A(G) = (a_{ij})_{i, j = 1,\dots, n}$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$) denote it's adjacency matrix.
			
			For all of $G$'s vertices $v_1, ..., v_n$ ($n \in \mathbb{N}$), let $\sigma(v_i)$ denote a selection function that assigns each vertex it's partition:
\[
 \sigma(v) =
  \begin{cases}
   -1 & \text{if } v \text{ in partition \#1}\\
   1 & \text{if } v \text{ in partition \#2}
  \end{cases}
\]
Let $\mathbf{x}$ denote
	\begin{equation*}
		A(G) \cdot (\sigma(v_1), \dots, \sigma(v_n))^\top = \mathbf{x} = (x_1, \cdots, x_n)^\top
	\end{equation*}
We will prove that $(\sigma(v_1), \dots, \sigma(v_n))^\top$ is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue $-d$ by showing that $\mathbf{x} = (-d \cdot \sigma(v_1), \dots, -d \cdot \sigma(v_n))$.\\

For any $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$,
\begin{equation*}
	x_i := \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} \cdot \sigma(v_j)
\end{equation*}
Since $v_i$ is only adjacent to vertices which are not in it's partition and $\sigma(v_i) = -\sigma(v_j)$ if $i, j$ are in different partitions.
\begin{equation*}
	x_i := \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} \cdot -\sigma(v_i)
\end{equation*}
Moreover, $G$ is $d$-regular. Thus,
\begin{equation*}
	x_i :=  \sum_{i=1}^d 1 \cdot -\sigma(v_i) = -d \cdot \sigma(v_i) 
\end{equation*}
Hence, $A(G) \cdot (\sigma(v_1), \dots, \sigma(v_n))^\top = \mathbf{x} = -d \cdot (\sigma(v_1) , \dots, \sigma(v_n) )^\top$ and thereby, $-d$ is an eigenvalue of $G$.
