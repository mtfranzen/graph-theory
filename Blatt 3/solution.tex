		\begin{theorem}{For a natural number $n \geq 2$ let $G = (V_G, E_G)$ be the graph of order $2n + 1$ obtained from $K_{n,n}$ by subdividing an edge by a vertex. Then, $\chi'(X) = \Delta(G) + 1 = n + 1$ but $\chi'(G - e) = \Delta(G - e)$ for any edge $e$ of $G$.}
			Let $V = \{v_1, ..., v_n\}$ and $W = \{w_1, ..., w_n\}$ denote the two partitions of $K_{n, n}$ and $\{c_k\ |\ k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ be a set of colors. Furthermore, let $u \in V_G$ be the vertex subdividing an edge between these two partitions.\\
		
			First, we will prove that $\chi'(X) = \Delta(G) + 1 = n + 1$. We will argue, that any partial coloring of $G$ will inevitably result in $n+1$ colors. 
%
% noncolored graph $G$, coloring the edges incident to a vertex $v \in V$ will inevitably result in $n + 1$ colors. Since $V$ and $W$ are entirely commutable, our proof will be sufficient after we consider the extra case in which we begin with coloring the edges of $u$.

		For each even integer $k > 1$, the complete graph $K_{(n+1)}$ is a $k$-regular graph with no 1-factor. 
		For each odd $k > 1$ we can construct a k-regular graph with no 1-factor in the following way. \\
		In order to garantee that the graph has no 1-factor we can use Tutt's theorem. 
		We construct the graph by starting of with one vertex $v$ connected to k subgraphs $S$ which are not inter-connected.

		\caption{Example with k=3}
		\end{figure}
		Then we construct $S=(V,E)$ in such a way that $|V|$ is odd and that all vertices in $V$ have degree k except of one vertex $u \in V$ with degree $k-1$. 
		If we then connect $u$ to $v$ we get a k-regular graph. 
		Using Tutt's theorem we know that the resulting graph has no 1-factor. 
		Because if $v$ is removed we get $k$ components $S$ with odd number of vertices and $k$ is greater than 1.\\ \\
		
		In order to contruct $S$ we first need the following lemma.
		\begin{lemma}{For any odd integer $k > 1$ it is possible to construct $(k-1)$-regular graph $G=(V,E)$ with $k+1$ vertices.}
			We can obtain $G$ from $K_{k+1}$ by removing by removing all the edges from $K_{k+1}$ contained in a perfect matching. 
			By removing the edges the degree of every vertex decreases exactly by one. 
			$K_{k+1}$ is by definition $k$-regular, hence $G$ is $k-1$-regular. 
			A perfect matching in $K_{k+1}$ exists, because $k+1$ is even, and the condition from Tutte's theorem always holds in a complete graph. 
			To find such a matching we can just randomly choose $(u,v)$ edges and remove $u$ and $v$ from $K_{k+1}$. 
		\end{lemma}
		
		
		\emph{Constructing a connected graph $S=(V,E)$ with $|V|=k+2$ and the degree sequence $( k,k,...,k,(k-1))$. }  
		First we construct a $(k-1)$-regular graph $S' = (V',E')$ with $k+1$ vertices as described in the lemma. 
		Then we can add one vertex to $S'$ and connect it to all vertices in $V'$ except of one vertex. 
		Thus we get a new graph $S$. 
		Because we only added one vertex $|V| = |V'| +1 = k+2$ and the degree of the newly added vertex is $k$.
		The degree of all the other vertices except of the last one is increased by one. 
		Hence, $S$ hat the degree sequence $(k,k,...,k,(k-1))$.

	In the following I will show that any graph $G$ with $2n$ vertices and all degrees at least $n$ has a 1-factor. 	
	I will show that if we divide such a $G$ into two parts we can remove edges until we get an bipartite 1-regular graph. 
	Then using the corollary of Hall's theorem we know we can find a perfect matching.
		\begin{theorem}{Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $|V| = 2n$ vertices with all degree atleast n, then $G$ has a 1-factor.}
		Because $|V| = 2n$ we can divide the vertices $V$ into two subsets $A,B \subset V$ with $|A|=|B|=n$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
