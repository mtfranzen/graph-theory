		\begin{theorem}{Any tree $T$ has at least $\Delta(T)$ leaves.}
			\begin {lemma}{Any connected subgraph of a tree is a tree as well.}
				If a graph $G = (V, E)$ is acyclic then $E$ does not contain any cyclic subset and hence there is no cyclic subgraph of $G$. From these considerations, any connected subgraph of $G$ is acyclic and therefore a tree.
			\end{lemma}
		
			\begin{lemma}{Any tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)+1$ vertices has $\Delta(T)$ leaves ($\Delta(T) \geq 1$).}
				Let $v_0 \in V_T$ denote the vertex of $T = (V_T, E_T)$ with $d(v_0) = \Delta(T)$.\\
				For any $v, w \in V_T\setminus\{v_0\}$ $(v \neq w)$:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $d(v) \geq 1$: $v_0$ is adjacent to $v$ since $|V_T| =  \Delta(T)+1$. $\Rightarrow d(v) \geq 1$
					\item $d(v) \leq 1$: Any edge $\{v, w\} \in E_T$ would create a cycle $(v_0, v, w, v_0)$ which would render $T$ invalid as a tree.
				\end{itemize}
				$\Rightarrow \forall v \in V_T\setminus\{v_0\}: d(v) = 1 \Leftrightarrow v \text{ is a leaf}$. Notably, $|V_T\setminus\{v_0\}| = \Delta(T)$.
			\end{lemma}

			\begin{lemma}{For any tree $T =  (V_T, E_T)$ with $|V_T| > \Delta(T)+1 \geq 3$, there exists a partition $(S, S')$  of $T$ with $\Delta(S) + \Delta(S') = \Delta(T)$.}
				Let $v_0 \in V_T$ denote a vertex with $d(v_0) = \Delta(T)$. Since $|V_T| > \Delta(T)+1$, $v0$ has at least one non-leaf adjacent vertex $v_1 \in V_T$. Now, let $(S_0, S_1)$ denote the partition at the edge $\{v_0, v_1\}$ whereby $S_0$ contains $v_0$ and ($S_1$, $v_1$ respectively).\\
				As seen in Lemma 1.1, $S_0$ and $S_1$ are trees.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item case $d(v_1) = 2$: In this case, a cut at the edge $\{v_0, v_1\}$ would make 
				\end{itemize}
			\end{lemma}
			\ \\
			\emph{Proof by induction.} Let $T = (V_T, E_T)$ be a tree.\\ \ \\
			\textbf{Basis: }$\Delta(T)=1$\\
				Inherently, $V_T =^! \{v_1, \dots, v_m\}$ $(v_i = v_j \Rightarrow i=j)$ and $E_T =^! \{\{v_1, v_2\}, ..., \{v_{m-1}, v_m\}\}$ $(m,i,j \in \mathbb{N})$. Any modification would violate our preconditions. $v_1, v_m$ are the only vertices with degree $1$. Therefore, the number of leaves is $2 \geq \Delta(T)$. \ \\

			\textbf{Step: }For some $n \in \mathbb{N}: \text{ Any } T = (V_T, E_T) \text{ with } \Delta(T) = n \text{ has at least } n \text{ leaves}$ .\ \\
			Let $T' = (V_{T'}, E_{T'})$ be a tree with $\Delta(T') > n$.

		\begin{theorem}{If any removal of an edge increases the number of connected components of a graph $G$ then $G$ is acyclic.}
			Let $S = (V_S, E_S)$ be a connected component of $G$. Removing any edge $e \in E_S$ increases the number of connected components and thereby disconnects $S$.\\
			\textbf{If $S$ had contained a cycle $C$ then there would not have been any unique paths in $C$}. Hence, no edge removal would have an effect on the connectivity of $S$ (removing an edge still leaves a path between any two vertices). Hereby, $S$ had to be acyclic.\\
			 If any connected component of $G$ was acyclic then $G$ would be acyclic, too.
		\end{theorem}
		\begin{theorem}{If adding any edge introduces a cycle in an acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ then any two vertices in $G$ are joined by a unique path.}
			If adding an edge $\{v_0, v_1\}$ joining two non-adjacent vertices $v_0, v_1 \in V$ introduces a cycle $(v_0, ..., v_1, v_0)$ then there had to be \emph{at least} one path from $v_0$ to $v_1$.\\
			Furthermore, if there was \emph{more than one} path joining $v_0$ and $v_1$ then there would have already been a cycle (but $G$ is acyclic). $\Rightarrow$ Any vertex had to be joined by a unique path.
		\end{theorem}
		\begin{theorem}{If any two vertices in a graph are joined by a unique path then any removal of an edge increases the number of connected components.}
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph in which all vertices are joined by a unique path. Let $e = \{v_0, v_1\} \in E$ be an edge. Thus, the unique path from $v_0$ to $v_1$ runs over (and is exactly) $e$. From these considerations, removing $e$ would make $v_1$ inaccessible from $v_0$ and would thereby increase the number of connected components.

		\begin{theorem}{Either a graph or its complement is connected.}
			For a connected graph, we're done.\\
			Let $G = (V, E)$ be disconnected. Moreover, let $S = (V_S, E_S)$ and $T = (V_T, E_T)$ be two connected components of G ($S \neq T$).\\
			Now let $u, v \in V_S \cup V_T$ be vertices in these components.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Case 1: } $u \in V_S$ and $v \in V_T$.\\
					Then $G$ does not contain the edge $e = \{u, v\}$ . Otherwise, S and T were interconnected. From these considerations, the graph's complement $\bar{G}$ does contain $e$.
				\item  \textbf{Case 2: } $u, v \in V_S$:\\
					Considering that $V_T$ is not empty, then there is a vertex $w \in V_T$ such that the edges $\{u, w\}$ and $\{v, w\}$ exist in $\bar{G}$ (see Case 1). From these considerations, $\bar{G}$ also contains the path $(u, w, v)$ .
			\end{itemize}
			Therefore, all vertices in a \emph{disconnected graph} $G$ are connected in $\bar{G}$ and hereby $\bar{G}$ is connected.\\

		I will prove the theorem that if u and v are the only vertices with odd degree in a graph $G$, then there is a path connecting $u$ and $v$, by assuming there is no path connecting $u$ and $v$ and leading this assumption to the contradiction that G is no valid graph. 
		\begin{theorem}{If $u$ and $v$ are the only vertices of odd degree in a graph then there is a $u$-$v$-path.}
		Let $G$ be a graph with edges $u,v \in V(G)$ and let $u$ and $v$ be the only vertices with odd degree in G. 
		Assuming there is no path connecting $u$ and $v$ then $u$ and $v$ have to be in different components, because if they were in the same component there would be a path connecting $u$ and $v$. 
		Let $A$ be the component of $u$, then $u$ is the only vertex of odd degree in $A$ because as stated above $v$ is not in $A$. Because $u$ is the only vertex with odd degree in $A$ the sum over the degree of all vertices in $A$ is odd. 
		Using the theorem that the sum over the degrees over all vertices in a graph has to be even this leads to the conclusion that $A$ is no valid graph. 
		This is a contradiction to $A$ being a valid component of $G$, hence the assumption that there is no path connecting $u$ and $v$ must be wrong leaving the only conclusion that there is a $u$-$v$-path.
